# Linot — Real-Time Whot on Linera Microchains

> A lightning-fast, blockchain-powered card game built on **Linera microchains**.  
> Linot combines nostalgic gameplay with real-time betting to show what **low-latency blockchain gaming** can truly feel like.

---

## Overview

**Linot** is a multiplayer Whot-style card game built on Linera’s microchain architecture.  
It reimagines the classic local card game we grew up playing as kids — but this time, every move happens instantly.

Players can challenge friends, join tournaments, or spectate live matches.  
Spectators can even **bet on matches in real time**, with odds that update dynamically as the game progresses.

### What We’re Proving

> Real-time, on-chain gaming _is possible_ — with the right infrastructure.
> That structure is _Linera_

Most blockchain games are slow because transactions wait in queues.  
With Linera’s **parallel microchains**, every match gets its own chain.  
That means **sub-second latency**, no congestion, and gameplay that feels like Web2 for once.

## Current Hackathon Status — Wave 2 (Nov 3–12)

### ✅ **Wave 2 Complete: Multiplayer Foundation & Production-Ready Backend**

Wave 2 successfully transformed Linot from a prototype into a functional multiplayer game with a production-ready backend architecture.

#### Major Achievements:

**Game Logic & Multiplayer:**

- ✅ **Complete Whot ruleset** implemented with all 6 special cards (Whot, Hold On, Pick Two, Pick Three, Suspension, General Market)
- ✅ **Human-vs-human mode** (2–4 players) synchronized over dedicated match microchains
- ✅ **On-chain match creation** with automatic microchain instantiation per game
- ✅ **Turn-based enforcement** with caller authentication and validation
- ✅ **Win/draw detection** with proper game state transitions

**Backend Architecture:**

- ✅ **Professional error handling** system with custom `LinotError` type replacing all panics
- ✅ **Full GraphQL service layer** with 12+ queries for game state
- ✅ **Secure player views** preventing card leakage to opponents
- ✅ **Type-safe state management** using Linera Views (RootView + RegisterView)
- ✅ **Clean separation** of concerns (contract, service, game engine, state)

**Technical Improvements:**

- ✅ Deterministic shuffling using chain ID as seed for consensus
- ✅ Automatic deck reshuffling when draw pile is empty
- ✅ Penalty stacking for Pick Two/Pick Three cards
- ✅ Last card challenge system with automatic enforcement
- ✅ Player forfeit handling with winner determination

#### Code Quality:

- ✅ 0 compilation errors
- ✅ 0 warnings
- ✅ Follows Linera SDK best practices
- ✅ Matches patterns from reference projects (Microbet, ChainClashArena)

#### What's Ready:

- ✅ Backend contract deployable to Linera testnet
- ✅ GraphQL service ready for frontend integration
- ✅ Full game playable end-to-end on-chain

#### Still in Progress:

- 🚧 Frontend integration with GraphQL queries
- 🚧 Spectator betting UI (smart contract hooks prepared)
- 🚧 Comprehensive test suite
- ⏳ Computer opponent (deferred to post-Wave 3)

**Documentation:**

- See [`backend/WAVE2_IMPROVEMENTS.md`](backend/WAVE2_IMPROVEMENTS.md) for detailed technical breakdown
- See [`backend/CONTRACT_BUILD_GUIDE.md`](backend/CONTRACT_BUILD_GUIDE.md) for deployment instructions

**Next up (Wave 3):** Frontend-backend integration, betting mechanics finalization, comprehensive testing, and state persistence hardening.

## Core Concept

| Feature                        | Description                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gameplay**                   | Fast, familiar Whot-style strategy game with action cards                                           |
| **Microchain per Match**       | Each match runs on its own microchain — zero lag, no interference                                   |
| **Prediction Market Layer**    | Spectators place live bets; odds adjust dynamically via an on-chain pool                            |
| **Manual Reward Distribution** | Winners and top players are recorded on-chain, with rewards manually handled during the early phase |
| **Web2 Feel, Web3 Power**      | GraphQL subscriptions + Linera’s instant state updates                                              |

---

## Gameplay Loop

1. **Match Creation:**  
   A player creates a match → Linera spawns a dedicated microchain instance.

2. **Join & Sync:**  
   2–4 players join. Game state syncs instantly through Linera’s low-latency channels.

3. **Real-Time Play:**  
   Each move is recorded on-chain and confirmed in milliseconds.

4. **Spectator Betting:**  
   Spectators view live matches and bet on the winner. Odds adjust automatically.

5. **End of Match:**  
   Results finalize instantly; winnings or recognition handled manually for now.
